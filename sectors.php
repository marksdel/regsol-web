				If you are setting out on your journey as a broker or retail intermediary in Ireland, you will need to be authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland. We can help with putting together your application and managing the process with the CBI. Click <a href="consulting.php#authorisations">here</a> to find out how.
				<br><br>
				If your brokerage or retail intermediary is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, you will need to comply with various regulations such as Anti-Money Laundering. Specifically, you will need –
				<br><br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Policy documents</b> - we can help by reviewing/authoring your policies/procedures.</li>
					<li><b>Training</b> - We can ensure you meet your training obligations by advising you about those requirements (which courses are mandatory, CPD hours, training logs, etc), and training your staff to a high level of competence in a flexible manner. See our course descriptions here.</li>
					<li><b>Procedures</b> - We perform audits and testing of your compliance procedures in order to gauge regulatory compliance and conformance with your own policies. We provide comprehensive reports which typically serve as a roadmap for you to enhance levels of compliance iteratively.</li>

				<h3 class="text-left">Fintech</h3>
				<br>
				The word “Fintech” can mean vastly different things to different people. However, regardless of whether your business is trading crypto-currencies, disrupting retail banking or something completely different, you will face similar issues to other firms in dealing with regulated or unregulated products/offerings. If you have (or intend to have) customers then Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), data protection (e.g. GDPR) and consumer protection (in the case of B2C) are all areas that you should be thinking about. 
				<br><br>
				While crypto-currencies are not generally regulated instruments in the eyes of the Central Bank of Ireland, this does not mean that they are not subject to regulatory provisions with regards to customer protection and market operations. Whether you are a virtual asset service provider (VASP) facilitating crypto-currency trades or proprietary trading, there is no doubt that doing the right thing will positively impact your bottom line and future-proof your business in terms of adapting to a changing regulatory landscape.
				<br><br>
				The Irish government is committed to developing Ireland as a global leader in the financial services sector, which has been accelerated by Brexit and continues to grow at pace. Ireland is already recognised as a technology centre of excellence and is therefore a natural fit for the Fintech industry.
				<br><br>
				At RegSol, we deal with many Fintech firms across a broad spectrum of activities and can help you navigate the tricky waters of compliance in the Irish market. <a href="about.php#contact">Contact us</a> today to discuss your requirements and we will be very glad to assist.

				<h3 class="text-left">Estate Agents</h3>
	
				Property Service Providers (PSPs) are identified as “Designated Persons” under Irish law and are among a number of professions who may be exposed to money laundering. There is therefore an obligation to ensure that they have clear policies and procedures for customer on-boarding, payments, etc, and that agents fully understand these. 
				<br><br>
				The Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA) have some great resources and templates on their website regarding customer due diligence, particularly around Anti-Money Laundering (AML). These templates can be used to form a compliance framework if you are starting off or to compare against your existing policies/procedures.

				<h3 class="text-left">Trust and Company Service Providers (TCSPs)</h3>
				
				If your business involves acting “on behalf of” another company (or companies) then are required to be authorised and monitored by either the Department of Justice (DoJ) or the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) as a TCSP. As an authorised entity you will be required to notify your regulator immediately of any material changes (change in Director, Secretary, etc) to your company. You will also have various other regulatory obligations regarding on-boarding, anti-money laundering, data protection, etc.
