				RegSol specialises in regulatory compliance. If your firm is a regulated entity or would like to become regulated, we can definitely help with your compliance needs. 
				<br><br>
				If you are looking to get authorised, our <a href='#authorisations'><b>Authorisation Application</b></a> service is for you. We have extensive experience with regulators such as the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) and Department of Justice and can help you navigate the entire process from start to finish. 
				<br><br>
				Our consultants are also experts at <a href='#policy'><b>drafting and reviewing</b></a> compliance documentation such as Terms of Business, Privacy Notice, etc. along with a wide range of compliance policies and procedures. In addition, we can help to design and validate processes/procedures to ensure the highest levels of compliance with various regulations. 
				<br><br>
				For existing authorised entities, our <a href='#Audit'><b>compliance reviews</b></a> (CPC / AML / GDPR) offer independent assurance testing of processes and procedures. Our post-review report leaves clients with a clear understanding of how well they are addressing their regulatory obligations and a concise action plan for any remediation items. 
				<br><br>
				We also engage regularly on topic specific projects such as AML Inspection support, new regulation gap analysis and implementation e.g. IAF/SEAR, general compliance advice, IQ Submission, etc. 
				<br><br>
				For firms that would like access to ongoing compliance support, our <a href='#retainer'><b>Retainer</b></a> model means you will have the best compliance assistance available to you whenever you need it and at the level that you need it. We will answer any ad hoc queries that may arise e.g. “how does this new legislation apply to my firm?” in addition to spending time helping with your ongoing compliance plan tasks. We truly believe that having your compliance framework in good shape should be a business enabler rather than a tick-the-box exercise, and we would love to partner with you on this journey.

			<h1>Compliance Support / Retainers</h1>
				<div class="text-left">
					<p class="text-left">It can often be difficult to get a quick answer to a compliance query. Whether or not you have an in-house compliance officer, it can be very beneficial to have an independent opinion which is backed by substantial cross-industry experience. Our consultants have considerable experience advising on regulatory compliance issues including Central Bank regulation, Anti-Money Laundering and Data Protection. Our flexible approach to regulatory compliance consulting allows you to access the level of support you need, from reviewing a single item to a full compliance framework overhaul, we can help!</p>
					Feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@regsol.ie">info@regsol.ie</a> or by phone <a href="tel:+35315394884">+353 1 539 4884</a> and we will be happy to assist.   
					<br><br>				
					<h3 class="text-left">Compliance Advice / Compliance Projects</h3>
					Sometimes a compliance query will pop up that no one internally can answer. It could be as specific as ‘does this regulation apply to us?’ or ‘Is this Terms of Business fully compliant?’. We can provide regulatory advice on a ‘pay by the hour’ basis for such queries. Sometimes larger projects are required, such as building out an entire AML Framework or a Risk-Based Compliance Monitoring Program or an entire Compliance Framework. For such projects we are happy to provide a quote based on estimated time on a cost per day basis and will always endeavour to provide a total ‘project fee’ amount. 
					<br><br>
					<h3 class="text-left">Ongoing Compliance Support Retainer</h3>
					For firms in need of ongoing compliance support or those wanting the assurance of having independent compliance advice close at hand for whenever it may be needed, our Compliance Support Retainer service is for you. Our flexible approach to our retainer services mean you can avail of guaranteed support from half a day to 4 days per month (averaged time commitment across 12 months) depending on the level of your firm’s needs. Equally we can act as an outsourced compliance function for those firms who don’t currently require an internal resource.  
					Our standard retainers generally include the following - 
					<ul><li>RegSol Quarterly compliance update – detailing changes in applicable regulations, etc.</li>
						<li>Access to compliance consultancy via email/phone for ad hoc compliance queries</li> 
						<li>Development of an Annual Compliance Plan which includes:</li>
						<ul><li>Periodic review of compliance policies and procedures</li>
							<li>Annual check that key front line compliance tasks have been completed (e.g. CBI returns, PII Renewal, etc.)</li>
							<li>Sample file review</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Support in implementing the Annual Compliance Plan</li>
						<li>Board / Senior Management Reporting at an agreed frequency to include:</li>
						<ul><li>Compliance Review Activities undertaken</li>
							<li>Compliance Review Activities planned</li>

						</ul>
					</ul>
					<br><br>
