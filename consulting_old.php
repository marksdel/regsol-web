				<h2>Who is covered by the GDPR?</h2> 
				<p class="text-left">The law applies to any organization conducting business in the EU as well as to organizations outside the EU that collect, process, or store information on EU citizens as well as on non-citizens while they reside in the EU.</p> <ul> <li>Non-EU companies that employ EU citizens (regardless of location)</li> <li>Non-EU companies that collect, process, or store data on EU citizens and/or residents (even, for example, an IP address for a single individual)</li> </ul> 
				
				<h2>What should you do?</h2>
