					<h2>Industry-specific, Localised Content</h2>				
					
					<ul><li>A common complaint with online training is that it is often too generic. All of our content and courses are developed in-house, which allows us to <b>tailor modules quickly</b> and efficiently.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Our courses are created specifically for industries and organisations based in Ireland.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Organisations are provided with their own private branded portal which allows administrators (HR, Compliance, IT, management, etc) to setup/remove users, assign courses to users and track progress against various courses.
						<br>
						<li>Tailoring options include industry standard, addition of company-specific policies, branding/co-branding.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Bulk creation of users and automatic assignment of courses is also supported.</li>
						<br>

					<h2>Key Aspects of RegSol e-Learning Courses</h2>				
					
					<ul><li>We develop interactive courses which encourage users to engage with the content and learn it fully, without employing tricks which often only serve to frustrate users.</li>
						<br>
						<li>All courses can be completed on desktop or tablet platforms. We find that the content is too detailed for mobile devices and interactivity suffers if it is simplified.</li>
						<br>
						<li>For each course, users are required to both complete every section and also pass a quiz (pass mark is set at 80% unless otherwise stated).</li>
						<br>
						<li>Our pricing model is based on number of licences. One licence entitles one user to access one course for a duration of one year. </li>
						<br>
